<h3>Lord of The Rings [Trilogy]</h3>
<p>When it pertains to character development and storyline, it get's no better than this series.</p>
<h3>Equalizer One & Two</h3>
<p>First, let's start by mentioning that Denzel Washington is lead for both movies. Should I say more?</p>
<h3>The Tourist</h3>
<p>Not an overly emotional guy, but this movie definitely made me shed a few tears and really look forward to what my love life will become.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Though it may not rival Lord of the Rings, the enthralling character development and captivating storyline are truly remarkable! Plus, the breathtaking scenery of each location is masterfully captured, leaving you in awe.</p>
<h3>Toy Story 3</h3>
<p>Before later on in life, I thought this was the last movie and it made me cry. I grew up on Toy Story, so my connection to the storyline was deep. Great kids movie for sure.</p>
